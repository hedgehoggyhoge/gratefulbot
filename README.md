> Gratitude practices are a scientifically recognized way to improve your well-being and quality of life.


> Practice, which seems ridiculously simple — every day write what you are thankful for — like meditation, can lead to quite measurable improvements in health, a healthier heart, better sleep, less pain, better relations and even to resist depression and suicidal thoughts (although replacement therapy and treatment, as well as the practice of mindfulness, is not).
>

> Recommendations to practice gratitude are found in many evidence-based well-being guides (for example, the Mayo Clinic Guide to a Healthy Lifestyle).
